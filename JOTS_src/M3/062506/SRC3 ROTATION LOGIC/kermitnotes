      Direct Serial Port
              Connect the two computers, A and B, with a null modem cable (or
              two modem cables interconnected with a null-modem adapter or
              modem eliminator). From Computer A:
                                                                                
                set modem type none   ; There is no modem
                set line /dev/ttyS0   ; Specify device name
                set carrier-watch off ; If DTR CD are not cross-connected
                set speed 57600       ; Or other desired speed
                set flow rts/cts      ; If RTS and CTS are cross-connected
                set parity even       ; (or "mark" or "space", if necessary)
                set stop-bits 2       ; (rarely necessary)
                set flow xon/xoff     ; If you can’t use RTS/CTS
                connect               ; Enter Connect (terminal) state
                                                                                
              This assumes Computer B is set up to let you log in. If it
              isn’t, you can run a copy of Kermit on Computer B and follow
              approximately the same directions. More info: As above plus HELP
              CONNECT.
                                                                                
       With modems or direct serial connections, you might also have to "set
       parity even" (or "mark" or "space") if it’s a 7-bit connection.
